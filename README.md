# Project Title
Salifort Motors Employee Retention Project

# Project Overview
Salifort Motors is currently facing a significant issue with employee turnover. This includes both employees choosing to leave and those who are let go. High turnover not only affects the corporate culture but also poses financial challenges due to the costs associated with recruitment, training, and upskilling. To address this issue, Salifort Motors aims to predict employee departures and understand the underlying reasons.
Business Understanding
This project seeks to address the high turnover issue at Salifort Motors by predicting and understanding employee departures. The leadership team aims to create a corporate culture that fosters employee success and development while saving costs associated with turnover.

# Data Understanding
- The project begins with a survey of a sample of employees to gather insights into the factors driving turnover.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed to understand the data better.
- The dataset includes information such as job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant data points.
- It's important to note any data limitations.

# Modeling and Evaluation
The approach involves building predictive models to determine if an employee will leave the company based on various factors. Two main modeling approaches are considered:
## 1.	Logistic Regression
- Precision: 80%
- Recall: 83%
- F1-score: 80%
- Accuracy: 83%
## 2.	Tree-based Machine Learning (Random Forest)
- AUC: 93.8%
- Precision: 87.0%
- Recall: 90.4%
- F1-score: 88.7%
- Accuracy: 96.2%
  
# Conclusion
The predictive models developed in this project offer valuable insights into employee retention at Salifort Motors. The random forest model outperformed other models and can be used to predict employee departures effectively.
Recommendations and Next Steps
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations and next steps are suggested to increase employee retention:
- Implement a cap on the number of projects employees can work on.
- Consider promoting employees with four or more years of tenure.
- Review workload and reward employees accordingly for longer hours.
